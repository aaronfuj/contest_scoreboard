Instructions for setting up a DNS so that the ip doesn't need to be typed:

1. Make sure the router always recognizes that the particular computer should map to a particular IP, via mac address.
2. Install dnsmasq so the computer can act as a DNS.

3. Configure dnsmsaq: https://passingcuriosity.com/2013/dnsmasq-dev-osx/
4. Potentially alias the commands for starting/stopping

I've used:

alias start_dns="sudo launchctl stop homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq"
alias stop_dns="sudo launchctl stop homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq"

5. Configure the router to point to the IP of the computer as a DNS server
