================================
New Tiebreaking
================================
Get the scoring fields for all riders (Based on X scores)
Find all tied riders
  Current counter is Y (starts at 1)
  As long as there are tied riders continue
    Try decremental counting
      If X-Y > 0
        Use the value Y as the top X-Y amounts of scores needed as long as X-Y > 0
        Check for tie
          Break if found
    Try incremental counting
      Use X+Y scores
      Check for tie
        Break if found
    Increment Y



================================
Tiebreaking old way
================================
Sort riders by highest score

Iterate through riders
  If this riders score is the same as the last processed rider
    If we already have another rider in a tie, then store this rider as part of the tie and use the 'overall rank' as its value
    Otherwise, start a running tie count to keep track of these two riders

  Otherwise, if this rider is currently in a tie (and doesn't have the same score) - This actually means that the current rider is not in a tie, but instead the previous rider was tied so lets calculate those previous riders
    Sum up the rank of all the tied riders
    Divide the sum by the number of tied riders
    Store this rank as the true value for all of the tied riders
    Reset the collection of tied riders
    Reset that there is no tie anymore
    
    Set the current riders rank to be the overall rank (since this rider had nothing to do with the prev)

  Otherwise, this rider seems fine (for now)
    Set this riders rank to be whatever the next rank is

  Iterate the overall rank
  Save what this riders score was as the previous score
  Save what this riders ID was as the previous id
