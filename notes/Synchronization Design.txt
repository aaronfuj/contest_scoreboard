Within a heat, there is a wave number for every score, this wave number starts at 0

1. Judge submits score to server.
2. Server receives the score and marks it with a timestamp.
3. Server uses the score information to get the heat and rider info, then queries for the scores associated with this rider in this heat
4. If this rider has no scores, then it will take the wave number last used in this heat

If the rider has scores
  Get all the relevant scores by checking the last X amount of time for the scores
  For those scores, find the ones submitted by this judge

  If this judge did submit a score within this period
    Get the last score submitted by this judge
    Get the waves that have been submitted by everyone else other than this judge

    If someone else submitted a newer wave
      Use that newer wave
    Otherwise
      Create a new wave number and use that (this is the first judge to submit the score)

  Otherwise if this judge hasn't submitted anything during this period
    If someone else submitted something during this period
      Use the earliest wave number
    Otherwise nobody else submitted anything either
      Use a new wave number

Otherwise the rider has no scores
  Use a new wave number





===============================

Different Scenarios
1. Judge and Server start fresh with no scores for anyone
2. Server is running, Judge refreshes page to start initialized
3. Judge misses a score, is now unsynchronizes
